## Common installation issues

### Linux permission issues

When installing Claude Code with npm, you may encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (eg. `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### Recommended solution: Create a user-writable npm prefix

The safest approach is to configure npm to use a directory within your home folder:

```bash
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt

# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global

# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc

# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Optional: Reinstall your previous global packages in the new location
# Look at ~/npm-global-packages.txt and install packages you want to keep
```

This solution is recommended because it:

* Avoids modifying system directory permissions
* Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
* Follows security best practices

#### System Recovery: If you have run commands that change ownership and permissions of system files or similar

If you've already run a command that changed system directory permissions (such as `sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn) /usr && sudo chmod -R u+w /usr`) and your system is now broken (for example, if you see `sudo: /usr/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set`), you'll need to perform recovery steps.

##### Ubuntu/Debian Recovery Method:

1. While rebooting, hold **SHIFT** to access the GRUB menu

2. Select "Advanced options for Ubuntu/Debian"

3. Choose the recovery mode option

4. Select "Drop to root shell prompt"

5. Remount the filesystem as writable:
   ```bash
   mount -o remount,rw /
   ```

6. Fix permissions:

   ```bash
   # Restore root ownership
   chown -R root:root /usr
   chmod -R 755 /usr

   # Ensure /usr/local is owned by your user for npm packages
   chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME /usr/local

   # Set setuid bit for critical binaries
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/su
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/passwd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/newgrp
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/gpasswd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chsh
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chfn

   # Fix sudo configuration
   chown root:root /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chmod 4755 /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chown root:root /etc/sudo.conf
   chmod 644 /etc/sudo.conf
   ```

7. Reinstall affected packages (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   # Save list of installed packages
   dpkg --get-selections > /tmp/installed_packages.txt

   # Reinstall them
   awk '{print $1}' /tmp/installed_packages.txt | xargs -r apt-get install --reinstall -y
   ```

8. Reboot:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

##### Alternative Live USB Recovery Method:

If the recovery mode doesn't work, you can use a live USB:

1. Boot from a live USB (Ubuntu, Debian, or any Linux distribution)

2. Find your system partition:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

3. Mount your system partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt  # replace sdXY with your actual system partition
   ```

4. If you have a separate boot partition, mount it too:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot  # if needed
   ```

5. Chroot into your system:

   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo chroot /mnt

   # For Arch-based systems:
   sudo arch-chroot /mnt
   ```

6. Follow steps 6-8 from the Ubuntu/Debian recovery method above

After restoring your system, follow the recommended solution above to set up a user-writable npm prefix.

## Auto-updater issues

If Claude Code can't update automatically, it may be due to permission issues with your npm global prefix directory. Follow the [recommended solution](#recommended-solution-create-a-user-writable-npm-prefix) above to fix this.

If you prefer to disable the auto-updater instead, you can
set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` [environment variable](settings#environment-variables) to `1`

## Permissions and authentication

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#configuring-permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### ESC key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you're using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the ESC key doesn't interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains' default shortcuts.

To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Click the "Configure terminal keybindings" hyperlink next to "Override IDE Shortcuts"
3. Within the terminal keybindings, scroll down to "Switch focus to Editor" and delete that shortcut

This will allow the ESC key to properly function for canceling Claude Code operations instead of being captured by PyCharm's "Switch focus to Editor" action.

## Getting more help

If you're experiencing issues not covered here:

1. Use the `/bug` command within Claude Code to report problems directly to Anthropic
2. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) for known issues
3. Run `/doctor` to check the health of your Claude Code installation
