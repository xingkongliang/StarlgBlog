# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

* [Installed Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
* A terminal or command prompt open
* A code project to work with

## Step 1: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code prompt inside a new interactive session:

```
✻ Welcome to Claude Code!

...

> Try "create a util logging.py that..." 
```

## Step 2: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
> what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
> what technologies does this project use?
```

```
> where is the main entry point?
```

```
> explain the folder structure
```

<Note>
  Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context.
</Note>

## Step 3: Make your first code change

Now let's make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

<Note>
  Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.
</Note>

## Step 4: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
> what files have I changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```
> help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 5: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

* Locate the relevant code
* Understand the context
* Implement a solution
* Run tests if available

## Step 6: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:

**Refactor code**

```
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
> update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
