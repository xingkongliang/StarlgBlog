## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<prefix>:<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<prefix>`       | Command scope (`project` for project-specific, `user` for personal) |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension)   |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                            |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/project:`

In the following example, we create the `/project:optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/user:`

In the following example, we create the  `/user:security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Organize commands in subdirectories to create namespaced commands.

**Structure**: `<prefix>:<namespace>:<command>`

For example, a file at `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates the command `/project:frontend:component`

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

For example:

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /project:fix-issue 123
```

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context.

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### File format

Command files support:

* **Markdown format** (`.md` extension)
* **YAML frontmatter** for metadata:
  * `allowed-tools`: List of tools the command can use
  * `description`: Brief description of the command
* **Dynamic content** with bash commands (`!`) and file references (`@`)
* **Prompt instructions** as the main content

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

* An MCP server is connected and active
* The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
* The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### Naming conventions

* Server and prompt names are normalized
* Spaces and special characters become underscores
* Names are lowercased for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

* View all configured MCP servers
* Check connection status
* Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
* Clear authentication tokens
* View available tools and prompts from each server
